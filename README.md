# Advanced-Data-Mining-Techniques-in-Cyberbullying-Detection
This project explores the application of advanced data mining methods to detect and analyze cyberbullying on social media platforms. By leveraging classification, clustering, and association rule mining, we provide actionable insights and tools to enhance online safety.

### üîç Project Overview
Cyberbullying, a pervasive issue in the digital world, demands automated systems for detection and prevention. This project uses datasets from Kaggle to categorize cyberbullying based on factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and more.

### Key Features:
Classification Models: Implemented SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression for categorizing cyberbullying with notable accuracy.
Clustering: Used K-Means Clustering with PCA for dimensionality reduction to identify distinct themes and patterns.
Association Rule Mining: Discovered meaningful correlations using metrics like lift, support, and confidence.

### üìÇ Dataset
Fine-Grained Balanced Cyberbullying Dataset (Kaggle)
Twitter Sexism Parsed Dataset (Kaggle)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques & Tools
Text Preprocessing: TF-IDF, stopword removal, stemming
Dimensionality Reduction: PCA
Model Evaluation: Metrics such as recall, precision, F1-score, and balanced accuracy
Clustering Evaluation: Elbow Method and silhouette scores

### üåü Results
Achieved a classification accuracy of 77.34% with the Random Forest model.
Identified four unique clusters with distinct themes using K-Means.
Extracted high-lift association rules to highlight key patterns in cyberbullying behavior.

# üöÄ Future Scope
Address data imbalance for improved classification (e.g., underreported sexism cases).
Enhance clustering with sentiment analysis and hierarchical methods.
Explore deep learning models for more robust detection.
